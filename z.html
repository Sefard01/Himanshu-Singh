    I build products with logic and people with words.
  </p>

  <p>
    Himanshu Singh is a full-stack developer and author exploring the intersection
    of technology, creativity, and human thinking. He writes about how people
    learn, forget, observe, build, and become — blending research, real-life
    experiences, and reflective storytelling.
  </p>

  <p>
    His work ranges from web applications and developer education to Hindi-English
    essays and poetry such as <em>“मैं सोचता हूँ कि मैं सोचता हूँ”</em> and
    <em>“The Human Cloud.”</em> Whether he’s debugging JavaScript or dissecting the
    mind, his goal is the same: make complex things simple and human.
  </p>

  <p>
    He believes that code builds products, but words build people.
  </p>

  <p>
    In earlier chapters of his life, he worked in medical stores, labor jobs, and
    self-learning projects — experiences that now shape his grounded, no-nonsense
    approach to writing and development. He is currently focused on building
    independent products, publishing research-driven books, and teaching through
    documentation, blogs, and digital content.

    Building apps by day. Building minds by night.
